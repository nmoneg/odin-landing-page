# Odin Landing Page

[Instructions from here: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page]

For this project you’ll be creating an entire web page from a design we’ll provide for you. If you’ve been following along you should have the skills you need to accomplish this, but it may not be easy!

The design we’re providing you comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors we’ve used.

Download the design images and take a look at what you’re going to be creating here:

Image One (Full Design) - https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png

Image Two (Color and Fonts) - https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png

The font that’s being used in the images is roboto.
Hero text is the statement that appears at the top of a web page.
